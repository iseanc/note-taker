# A Note Taker

## Description

This project is built intended to explore web-server software and middleware components, client-server interaction (CRUD operations) through an internet browser, and publishing and accessing applications hosted on a web-hosting service (Heroku, etc).

LESSONS LEARNED:  
Most of the code for this project was provided, including the HTML, CSS, server.js, index.js, etc.; therefore, this project is predominantly an exercise in completing implementation of functionality designed, planned and partially implemented by other developers.

It has helped deepen my understanding of using Express JS as web-server middleware, and of connecting client-side functionality (esp. Javascript) to a server backend with data-persistence.

Modifying existing code to meet a defined set of requirements has been a good exercise in the cycle of reviewing code, implementing small changes, testing against requirements, and iterating the process as needed to implement all required features.
 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

- Node.js is required to run a local instance of this app.
- Fork or download the repository to a local machine.
- Run 'npm i' to install required Node packages.
- To run the app on a local machine, run 'node server.js' from the root directory.  Otherwise, publish the app code to a web service supporting Node.JS/Express.JS applications.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
