# A Note Taker

## Description

This project is built intended to explore web-server software and middleware components, client-server interaction (CRUD operations) through an internet browser, and publishing and accessing applications hosted on a web-hosting service (Heroku, etc).

LESSONS LEARNED:  
Most of the code for this project was provided, including the HTML, CSS, server.js, index.js, etc.; therefore, this project is predominantly an exercise in completing implementation of functionality designed, planned and partially implemented by other developers.

It has helped deepen my understanding of using Express JS as web-server middleware, and of connecting client-side functionality (esp. Javascript) to a server backend with data-persistence.

Modifying existing code to meet a defined set of requirements has been a good exercise in the cycle of reviewing code, implementing small changes, testing against requirements, and iterating the process as needed to implement all required features.

## Installation

- Node.js is required to run a local instance of this app.
- Fork or download the repository to a local machine.
- Run 'npm i' to install required Node packages.
- To run the app on a local machine, run 'node server.js' from the root directory.  Otherwise, publish the app code to a web service supporting Node.JS/Express.JS applications.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

- On the main page, click "Get Started"
- Existing notes appear on the left side of the page at page load.
- To add a new note, provide a title and text in the fields on the right side of the page, then click the save (disk) icon.  The new note appears at the bottom of the list on the left side of the page.
- Click an existing note title on the left side of the page to load it into the note viewer on the right side of the page.
- Click the delete icon (trash can) on any note in the left column to delete it.
